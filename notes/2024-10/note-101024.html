                my wife...<br>
                <br>
                i want to thank you for the best birthday I could ask for in my adult life;
                for the midnight notes, to the presence, to the presents (financial and others), and the email!
                i have been on a high since and i am not close to dropping, and that is how i feel w you,
                pure bliss.<br>
                i seem to constantly have reasons to appreciate you and God for being in my life,
                and contantly, consistently showing up for me.<br>
                thank you for being in my life, for staying in my life, for your love, care and support,
                for taking care of me, and trying to make sure i am fine in every way,
                for showing me everytime in new profound ways, that you love me.<br>
                i love you so much, and i seem to be able to try capturing it, but i promise,
                i couldn't fully do that, not with one or five lifetimes.<br>
                i hope our life gets better, i hope you are always beside me,
                i hope i can always make you smile, and feel good, and feel loved. like you make me.
                my fave. Jesus' fave. i love you. it is fr me and you, always.<br>
                <br>
                thank you very much, loml.<br>
