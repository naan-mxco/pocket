                hey BB,<br>
                <br>
                <i>
                    i know it is not the 1st,
                    but it is the 3rd, and today's numerology is 4, numbers important to us.
                    plus, it is Friday: 37 weeks together, so...
                </i><br>
                <br>
                i want to start by saying that 2024 was one of the most insanely best times of my life,
                and that is in most part because you stayed w me after 2023, and said yes to me.
                and although the first half of the year was just not rosy,
                you brought all the pink into the second (as i realise you have since '22),
                gave me a love that is so full, and made life a dream,
                just by being, and also by doing.<br>
                <br>
                and so i want to try to thank you: for saying yes to me,
                for being my friend, for being my bestie, for being mine, for loving me,
                for being the optimist, for teaching;
                for being the funniest, for the inside jokes,
                for day-long and night-long calls, for amebo, for constantly having my time;
                for spending time w me after news of grandma;
                for pre-camp, for camp, for post-camp, for cds;
                for places, spots, sites, and fct;
                for pancakes and garlicky tomatoeys and all the food,
                for being my big madam and funding my lifestyle,
                for gifts - in cash, livestock and shinies;
                for pushing for me -us- to do more and be more,
                for being all/most i can talk about, think about,
                for painting beautiful flexible visions of our future,
                <i>for being.</i><br>
                <br>
                i love you my madam Queencess, as intensely as You burn in my skies,
                and i can't wait to see how life gets better for us.
                i pray so much for it and i know you do too, and i can't wait for our life together,
                but then again, i can, because it is worth it!
                and this might sound corny, but,
                thank you for the happiest year of my lifeðŸŽ¶
                the dark skin funny sirl did save my life<br>
                <br>
                happy New Years light of my life <i>(for the 1500<sup>th</sup> time)</i>,
                we go harder again yeah?
