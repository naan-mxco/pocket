                    you're so beautiful and you look tired
                    so I'd rather you rested than disturb you to tell you that
                    the beginning of Silo season 2 was, as I now realise, moved to your laptop lol.<br>
                    <br>
                    you're my best friend and I love you so much, have loved you so much,
                    and I really want to do this life thing w you
                    and I want to get as many moments like this as I can through this lifetime.
                    I want to see and make you happy, and thriving and figuring it out.
                    I want to watch you shine as you should, my Sunny, and applaud you in every step you take.<br>
                    <br>
                    I don't think I could ever not love you.
                    you're etched in my soul and have become suxh a big part of me...
                    and I caannot wait for when we get to spend our lives and future together,
                    for the rest of it.<br>
