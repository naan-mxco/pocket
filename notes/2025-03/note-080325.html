                <p>
                    every year,
                    I am reminded of the depth of strength, love, and grace
                    that you bring into every corner of existence.
                    you are light of my life, subject of my dreams, and a gale.
                    your strength isn't always loud â€” it radiates in the quiet ways you move through life:
                    lifting, teaching, and loving in ways I never thought possible.
                    <br>
                    this year, I have watched you grow even more radiant, my Sunny.
                    you are a constant reminder that magic isn't just in fairy tales;
                    it's in your every breath, your every step.
                    you embody the quiet yet unstoppable force of transformation,
                    and the world is better because of it.
                    <br>
                    I stand in awe of you, the ways you love, the ways you dream, and the ways you fight.
                    you've reinforced my belief that love is a choice,
                    a constant act of growth and understanding, and I am thankful for that every single day.
                    <br>
                    may this day remind you, as it reminds me,
                    that you are not just <a href="https://x.com/bbnancy_/status/1766235297275060279">miraculous</a>,
                    you are the heartbeat of everything good.
                    the world owes so much of its beauty and light to you,
                    and I, for one, will always cherish you.<br>
                    <br>
                    to you, and all the women whose voices fill the world with power and grace â€“
                    <i>happy International Women's Day!</i><br>
                    <br>
                    with all my love, I hope to keep growing with you, for you, always. ðŸ–¤
