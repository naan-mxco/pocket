                <p>
                    I did not know what I was doing, not really.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    not when I first noticed that i was smitten by you.
                    not when I first kissed you, if you could even call that unplanned, raw, hungry stretch of time a kiss.
                    not when I told you I liked you.
                    not even when I said I love you (not out loud or in my head or the thousand quiet ways I kept meaning to say it).<br>
                    <br>
                    I was just following the pullâ€”blindfolded maybe,
                    but smiling, like a diver trusting the water to hold them.
                    like Icarus, drawn to the Sun,<br>
                    my Sun.<br>
                    <br>
                    I knew I was in love with youâ€”not in the way movies try to dramatize it,
                    but in the way that trees know when to bloom.<br>
                    quiet. certain. unavoidable.<br>
                    <br>
                    there have been days Iâ€™ve paused to ask;
                    how did it all happen?
                    this warmth? this softness we stitched between two people learning to breathe in each otherâ€™s rhythm?<br>
                    was it you? was it me?<br>
                    was it something older than us both?
                    something in the stars or in the small silences we never had to explain?<br>
                    <br>
                    love with you felt like a thunderclap.
                    it also felt like sunlight slowly filling a room I didnâ€™t know Iâ€™d locked.
                    no, Sunny, you didnâ€™t knockâ€”you just walked in, all warmth and laughter,
                    and suddenly my whole world was awake.<br>
                    <br>
                    with you, love came in pockets (pun half-intended).
                    in the way you say my name.
                    in sleepy good mornings and late night musings
                    of nothings and unspoken understandings.
                    in laughter that I didnâ€™t know I needed.
                    in the peace of sitting side by side,
                    not needing to fill the air with anything but presence.<br>
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://substack.com/@toniiabudu/note/c-108466799?r=di62z">"Love needs reality."</a><br>
                    not fantasy. not perfection. but reality.<br>
                    Iâ€™ve learned that with you.
                    with all your habits,
                    your softness and your storms,
                    your way of making the world feel less jagged.<br>
                    you are real. and I am not afraid to fall into your love,
                    because youâ€”you make the fall feel like flight.<br>
                    <br>
                    and I suppose I want to say thank you.<br>
                    for that.<br>
                    for this.<br>
                    for a year of choosing each other.
                    not just in easy, glittery moments,
                    but in the middle of messy, unshaped days
                    when weâ€™re tired or quiet or unsure.
                    you still choose me. and I am learning to choose you more gently,
                    more bravely, every time.<br>
                    <br>
                    so, to us, one year in ðŸ¥‚<br>
                    to every moment I dove without looking and found your arms in mine.<br>
                    to every night I curled up with doubt and woke up with certainty.<br>
                    to the soft hunger of that first kiss.<br>
                    to the way you yap like itâ€™s your job.<br>
                    to scratched noses and sleepy mornings.<br>
                    to making each other do things, and be better, and do better.<br>
                    to love thatâ€™s real. messy. alive. and here, with you, choosing each otherâ€”again and again.<br>
                    <br>
                    I do not know what the next year holds,
                    but if it's more of thisâ€”more of youâ€”
                    I am already grateful.<br>
                    <br>
                    happy anno-versary, my Sunny. I love you... more!
                    always and foreverðŸ–¤
