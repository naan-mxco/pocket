I wanna be in your life until the night is over
I wanna hold you so tight, so tight, come in closer
It's been a hell of a ride for every single moment
You were there by my side

...

Girl, I want to be dancin' with you forever
You see through the storm and take me as I am
Baby, it's magic any time that we're together
And make I just love you and hold you for my hand

...

Over and over again, yeah, my love is burning, baby
Feels like time is frozen and the night is for us
And we're alone again and every moment's golden, yeah
Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love

...

I wanna be in your life until the night is over
I wanna hold you so tight, so tight, come in closer
I wanna be in your life until the night is over
Until the night is over, until the night is over
